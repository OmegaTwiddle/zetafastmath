# Zeta Fast Math Privacy Policy

Zeta Fast Math does not collect any user data. At no point does the application collect any of your data, nor does it submit any of your data to any servers that belong to the developer. The app is fully a local experience on your device, aside from the integration(s) mentioned below.

## Apple Integration

While I as the developer do not collect any of your user data, the app does integrate with Apple backends to handle subscriptions, purchase information, and game center features. The app will confirm your subscription status through the StoreKit. This is done only to control the application flow, and is not sent to any of the developer's servers. The app also integrates with Apple's Game Center to keep track of leaderboards and achievements. I as the developer do not store any of this leaderboard information. In the future, the app may also integrate with CloudKit to help synchronize sessions across a user's multiple devices. This future integration will not affect the privacy policy above, as all of these integrations are between the device and Apple's ecosystem, not the developer's.
